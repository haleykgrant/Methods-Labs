# Methods-Labs
Labs for advanced methods in biostatistics III-IV (140.753-140.754), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. These files are the Rmd files I used to create html files (also included) when TAing this course. 

The topics covered by each lab are:

Term III:
  * Lab 1:
      * Data analysis basics
      * Fitting and interpreting generalized linear models (GLMs) (with data example)
  * Lab 2:
      * Poisson models and overdispersion (with data example)
      * Newton-Raphson algorithm and visualization
  * Lab 3: 
      * Zero-inflation (with data example)
  * Lab 4:
      * Review of third term materials

Term IV:
  * Lab 1:
      * Random/mixed effects models (motivation, interpretation, random slopes vs intecepts, and data example)
      * Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML)
  * Lab 2:
      * The EM algorithm and simulated data example
      * Solution to in-class exercise
  * Lab 3: 
      * MCMC
      * Metropolis algorithm: intuition, derivation and example 
      * Shiny app for choosing proposal distribution (there is a separate file for the shiny app since I post all files as html documents for students on the course website and shiny app didn't embed properly in html)
  * Lab 4:
      * Review of fourth term materials
